# CITS4407_Assessment2

This project contains three Bash scripts which will check the data quality, handle empty cells, clean the data, analyse and answer the research questions like:
        What is the most popular domain and most popular mechanics across the set of games (Appearance in a given game's list counts as 1.)?
        What is the correlation between publication year and average rating, e.g. newer games being preferred over older ones?
        What is the correlation between game complexity and average rating?
